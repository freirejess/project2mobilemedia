Many families and young people with autism and learning disabilities find visiting museums difficult, and many parents will forget about the whole idea from the fear of their child not enjoying themselves and not knowing what to expect when going there. Museums are a great learning and interactive resource; they support existing interests and encourage new ones. For children with autism developing social and educational behaviours is very important, which is why nothing should be stopping them from experiencing the museum environment.</font></p>

				<p><font face="my2font" size="4em" color="#000000">1 in every 88 children in New Zealand are on the Autism spectrum, and every 1 in 6 new Zealanders have a learning disability, that’s over 50,000 kiwis. Surveys show that parents with autistic kids have the highest levels of stress and planning anything with these children is challenging and time consuming, down to a simple trip to the hairdressers.<br><br>
                Parents with autistic kids struggle to make sure their kids always feel included and a part of everything that is going on, public outings can cause many issues and uncertainties. Which is a terrible shame considering how so many of these autistic children have the capability to completely immerse themselves into so many topics and subjects. Many of them which the museum can provide.<br><br>
                
                Now, can you imagine the struggle and panic that would surround taking your child to a busy, lively museum? Wouldn’t it be great to make the task easier and more accessible? </font></p>

            <p><font face="my2font" size="4em" color="#000000">My proposal is to create an APP that guides and supports families with autistic kids and for young people with learning disabilities and autism.<br>
-The APP would provide an interactive map different from others, which would advice to where bathrooms, cafes, lifts and quiet areas are. An APP that would transform the museum into a safe and comfortable zone for autistic children. <br>
-It would provide the family with images of the staff uniform and who to ask for help and images for the children to understand the entrance and main areas of the museum – knowing where they will be and what to expect can help the child remain calm and enjoy themselves.-<br>
-For a family with an autistic child navigating busy areas can be trick, anything can set the child off including bright lights, loud sounds and tight spaces. The APP would provide the best trails to take and exhibits that will be best enjoyed and ones to avoid.<br><br>
- The APP would encourage families with autistic kids to visit the museum, it would provide reassurence as to what expect, and how they'll feel there. This App would make the museum more accessible to more people.<br><br>

            <p><font face="my2font" size="4em" color="#000000">Finding a way to make every family feel comfortable, including families with autistic kids would mean more visitors in the museum. Parents knowing what to expect and knowing they have support from the staff and museum would make them feel welcomed and relaxed, it would encourage them to take their kids to a place that would be safe and happy. <br>It would also encourage young adults with autism to visit the museum, considering they would know where everything is and the best ways to get around. At interactive museums people are encouraged to touch, listen and even smell and taste things, and autistic kids need a hands-on learning style, it is very important for them and it helps them to develop their social and interactive skills, making trips to museums an essential part of their education and personal development. <br>This APP would not only help ‘up’ the accessibility of the museum but it would be a crucial element for parents to feel welcome in this environment and for kids with autism to get the best possible experience out of a museum with no hassles and problems.</font></p>
